            Mumbai is in all ways a mega-city driven by power, wealth, glamour
            and fame which attracts people to give shape to their dreams and
            aspirations. But it is also a city with strong historical links,
            wonderful British architecture, museums, beaches, places of worship,
            and above all, a true galaxy of stars where Bollywood reigns
            supreme.

            It is said that every train that comes to Mumbai brings on it
            hundreds of people from across India who are not only drawn to
            'experience' the city's mesmerising attractions but would also like
            to make it their home. A city of diverse cultures and a melting pot
            of commerce, industry, entertainment, enterprise, and politics,
            Mumbai's trysts with wealth and fame have, however, been recent. It
            wasn't a cosmopolitan finance centre to begin with. Its history has
            witnessed several shifts in power, and the seven islands changed
            hands frequently.

            communities that are settled in here. The culture here is a fine
            amalgamation of festivities, religions, music, food, music and
            theatres. Mumbai is said to have most active nightlife in comparison
            to other cities.
