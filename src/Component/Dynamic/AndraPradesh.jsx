            Andhra Pradesh is one of the 29 states of India, situated in the
            south-east of the country. It is the eighth-largest state in India,
            covering an area of 162,970 km2 (62,920 sq mi). As per the 2011
            census, it is the tenth most populous state, with 49,386,799
            inhabitants. The largest city in Andhra Pradesh is Visakhapatnam.
            Telugu, one of the Classical Languages of India, is the majority and
            official language of Andhra Pradesh. On 2 June 2014, the
            north-western portion of Andhra Pradesh was separated to form the
            new state of Telangana; the longtime capital of Andhra Pradesh,
            Hyderabad, was transferred to Telangana as part of the division.
            However, in accordance with the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act,
            2014, Hyderabad was to remain as the de jure capital of both Andhra
            Pradesh and Telangana states for a period of time not exceeding ten
            years. The new riverfront de facto capital, Amaravati, is under the
            jurisdiction of the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development
            Authority (APCRDA). Andhra Pradesh has a coastline of 974 km (605
            mi), the second longest coastline among the states of India, after
            Gujarat - with jurisdiction over almost 15,000 km2 of territorial
            waters. The state is bordered by Telangana in the north-west,
            Chhattisgarh and Odisha in the north-east, Karnataka in the west,
            Tamil Nadu in the south, and to the east lies the Bay of Bengal. The
            small enclave of Yanam, a district of Puducherry, lies to the south
            of Kakinada in the Godavari delta on the eastern side of the state.
            The state is made up of the two major regions of Rayalaseema, in the
            inland southwestern part of the state, and Coastal Andhra to the
            east and northeast, bordering the Bay of Bengal. The state comprises
            thirteen districts in total, nine of which are located in Coastal
            Andhra and four in Rayalaseema. The largest city and commercial hub
            of the state is Visakhapatnam, located on the Bay of Bengal, with a
            GDP of US$43.5 billion; the second largest city in the state is
            Vijayawada, located on the banks of the Krishna River, which has a
            GDP of US$3 billion (as of 2010).

          <p className="place_txt">History</p>
          <p>
            Andhra Pradesh is said to have been the home of the Pre-Dravidian
            inhabitants. The Andhra region witnessed the rule of Chandragupta
            Maurya during which it established itself as an independent kingdom.
            After Ashoka, the Mauryan empire declined, giving an opportunity to
            establish smaller kingdoms. In about the third century BC, the
            Satavahanas ruled for about five centuries. The Satavahanas
            established a strong rule with their territories extending up to
            Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. The Satavahanas were overpowered by
            the Ikshvakus by the third century AD. During this period,
            Brahmanism is said to have been revived, which reduced the influence
            of the Buddhist which was fostered by the Satavahanas.

          <p>
            The history of Andhra Pradesh is marked by the rise and fall of
            various dynasties and rulers. By the end of the third century AD,
            the Pallavas of Kanchi put an end to the rule of the Ikshavakus, and
            art and architecture advanced during their rule. The Anandas
            established their rule in the fourth century AD, which lasted till
            the sixth century. During the seventh century, the Eastern Chalukyas
            exercised their power for about four centuries, and literature was
            advanced during this period with the promotion of the Telugu script.
            The Kakatiyas, who were feudatories of the Eastern Chalukyas, became
            independent in about the 12th century. During the rule of the Delhi
            Sultanate, Muslims repeatedly attempted intrusion into Andhra. In
            1332 AD, Ulugh Khan established themselves. The Reddi Kingdom of
            Kondavidu, the Velama kingdom, and the Vijayanagar Kingdom also
            ruled independently during this period. The rule of Muhammad Tughlag
            witnessed the rise of independent Muslim Power at Bijapur under the
            Bahamani Sultanate. In 1518, the Sultan Qili Qutub Shah declared
            himself independent and founded the Qutub Shahi dynasty, which
            existed till 1687. During this period, literature, art, and
            architecture were advanced. The city of Hyderabad was laid in 1591
            by Muhammad Quli Qutub Shah. The Mughals put an end to the Qutub
            Shahi rule in 1687. After this, the Asafjahis or nizams emerged and
            influenced Andhra Pradesh till the 18th century. Andhra Pradesh was
            then ceded to the East India Company, and gradually the whole of
            Andhra Pradesh except Hyderabad was under the British till 1947. In
            1956, Andhra Pradesh was declared as a state.
